# üé® Level Creator Guide

The Level Creator is an interactive tool that lets you visually design levels and export the code.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Activating the Level Creator

Press **Ctrl+L** (Cmd+L on Mac) during gameplay to toggle the Level Creator UI.

### Controls

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| **Place Object** | Click on ground |
| **Select Object** | Shift + Click near object |
| **Delete Selected** | Delete key |
| **Move Selected** | Arrow Keys (Left/Right/Up/Down) |
| **Change Height** | PageUp / PageDown |
| **Toggle Grid Snap** | G |
| **Clear All** | C (or use Clear All button) |

### Interface

The Level Creator panel (top-right) lets you:

1. **Object Type**: Choose between Building or Target
2. **Building Types**:
   - Wall
   - Tower
   - Castle
   - Platform
   - Indestructible variants (Wall, Tower, Platform, Pillar, Block)
3. **Target Types**:
   - Basic
   - Soldier
   - Upgraded Soldier
   - Loot
   - Training Dummy
4. **Base X Position**: The reference X coordinate (default 25)
5. **Grid Snap**: Snap objects to grid (0 = no snap, 1 = 1 unit snap, etc.)

### Workflow

1. **Open Level Creator**: Press Ctrl+L
2. **Set Base X**: Choose where your level starts (e.g., 25, 30, 35, etc.)
3. **Select Object Type**: Choose building or target
4. **Select Specific Type**: Pick wall, tower, etc.
5. **Click to Place**: Click anywhere on the ground to place
6. **Adjust Position**:
   - Shift+Click to select an object
   - Use arrow keys to move it
   - Use PageUp/PageDown to adjust height
7. **Repeat**: Place all your objects
8. **Export Code**: Click "üìã Export Code" button
9. **Paste into Level.js**: The code is copied to clipboard!

## üìù Example

Let's create a simple level:

1. Press **Ctrl+L** to open creator
2. Set **Base X = 35**
3. Select **Building ‚Üí Platform**
4. Click at position (35, 0, 0) to place base
5. Select **Building ‚Üí Wall**
6. Click around the platform to add walls
7. Select **Target ‚Üí Soldier**
8. Click on top of a wall
9. Click **Export Code**
10. Paste into `src/Level.js` as `createLevel11()`:

```javascript
createLevel11() {
    // Generated by Level Creator
    const baseX = 35;

    // Buildings
    this.addBuilding(baseX, 0.2, 0.0, 'platform');
    this.addBuilding(baseX - 1.5, 1.5, -1.5, 'wall');
    this.addBuilding(baseX + 1.5, 1.5, -1.5, 'wall');
    
    // Targets
    this.addTarget(baseX, 2.8, 0.0, 'soldier');
}
```

11. Update `load()` method in `Level.js` to include case 11
12. Add level 11 button to `index.html`
13. Play your level!

## üí° Tips

- **Start with platforms**: Build from the ground up
- **Use grid snap (G)**: Makes alignment easier
- **Select & adjust**: Use Shift+Click and arrow keys for precision
- **Test frequently**: Export and test your level
- **Save your code**: Keep exported code in a text file while designing
- **Indestructible objects**: Use for challenges that require specific strategies
- **Layer vertically**: Use PageUp/PageDown to create multi-story structures

## üéØ Design Principles

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Make later levels more complex
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Allow different strategies
3. **Visual Clarity**: Don't overcrowd the space
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure level is possible to beat
5. **Use Variety**: Mix building types and target types

## üîß Technical Details

- Objects are placed at grid-snapped positions for consistency
- All positions are relative to `baseX` for easy level spacing
- Exported code uses the same `addBuilding()` and `addTarget()` methods
- Physics properties are automatically applied based on object type

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Can't see UI**: Make sure you pressed Ctrl+L in-game (not on main menu)
- **Objects not placing**: Make sure you're clicking on the ground plane
- **Export not working**: Check browser console for errors
- **Code not formatted**: The export should auto-format; if not, manually adjust indentation

## üöÄ Next Steps

After creating your level:

1. Add it to the level switch in `Level.js`
2. Add a button in `index.html` level selector
3. Test for difficulty and completability
4. Adjust `baseX` in other levels if needed for proper spacing
5. Share your level design!

Happy level creating! üé®üéÆ
